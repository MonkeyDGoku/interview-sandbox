# Isograms

An isogram is a word that has no repeating letters, consecutive or non-consecutive. This is a function that determines whether a string that contains only letters is an isogram. Assume the empty string is an isogram. Ignore letter case.

    isIsogram("Dermatoglyphics") == true
    isIsogram("aba") == false
    isIsogram("moOse") == false // -- ignore letter case

In this case, we have some working code, but no tests to prove the function works. Implement tests to handle all cases listed above.
