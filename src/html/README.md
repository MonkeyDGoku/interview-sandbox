# Instructions

The current menu is styled to only work for desktop but we would like it to be responsive. Please change the code so that when the page's width is under 600px, the menu is stacked below the "Website" logo and both the logo and items in the menu are all centered.

## Acceptance Critaria

- When page's width is over 600px, Header should continue to look as is
- When page's width is under 600px, each list item in the menu should stack underneath eachother and the logo
- When page's width is under 600px, the logo and menu list should all be centered
